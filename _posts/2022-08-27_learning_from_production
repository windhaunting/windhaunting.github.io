I have been working on ML supply chain inventory problem 
a cycle:


business use case requirement? problem -> data aquistion/collection/preparaton-> feature engineering-> modeling/hypotheistis/evaluation/interpretation -> deployment--> production/operations-> optimization  
then go back circle.


what I learned?

most of the difficult part is the data aquisition,  prepration and feature engineering.

not like in the academic, lots of scenarios use the data 


which models?
 the drawback of regression and tree-based model?

which features?

production problem?

mlops monitoring

Explanability and privacy


most
