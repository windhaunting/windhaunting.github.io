Here we introduce a Youtube's recommendation system based on deep neural networks. It consists of a deep candidate generation model and then a separate deep ranking model. Youtube recommendations have to deal with scalability, freshness and noises of user feedbacks.
The two-stage of this model can get a small personalized and accurate recommendation for users from a large of millions of videos.

#### The candidate generation architecture

* The purpose of candidate generation is to get a high recall.
 
* Input features for candidate generation:
each user's YouTube activity history (IDs of video watches, search query tokens and demographics, geographic and device features.)
 
* Offline evaluation: precision, recall, ranking loss... Online evaluation: A/B testing measuring click through rate, watch time.
 
* It models as extreme classification each video $$i$$ is a class.
 
* It uses the implicit feedback [16] of watches to train the model, where a
user completing a video is a positive example.
 
* It uses a user's history only to predict future watch instead of a held-out watch, which leaks future information.
 
* Sample negative classes with importance weighting are used for classification speedup.
 
* Training examples ages are used as additional features to deal with the freshness of recommendation.
 
* It generates a â€€fixed number of training examples per user, effectively weighting
our users equally in the loss function, as this prevents a small cohort of highly active users from dominating the loss.
 
 
#### The Ranking architecture

* Ranking uses the similar deep neural network architecture as candidate generation, which assigns an independent score to each video impression using logistic regression.
 
* Proper normalization of continuous features was critical for convergence.
 
* It is to predict expected watch time given training examples that are either positive (the video impression was
clicked) or negative (the impression was not clicked).
 
#### Code implementation
Youtube data is not public.
We uses a small sampled movieLen dataset to simply implement a basic architecture.
