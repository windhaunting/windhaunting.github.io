It is my great fortune to work on Omdena's AI project with Poikilingo. The problem was to build a recommender system that helps the study of bilingual children, including immigrant and refugee children that adapts to the level of the children as they progress in the app, ensuring a personalized learning experience for each individual child.

I have contributed the task of developed content-based recommender system model. I proposed the moving average-based sequence recommendation algorithm which has been widely recognized. Except from this, I have been involved in the complete machine learning system process from design, data retrieval, data simulation, data processing, modeling, development and visualization. I also enjoyed the great cooperation of awesome people on achieving the great project together. On this project I worked with a great，enthusiastic, recreative team.

Lastly I would like to thank the entire Omdena team for providing me this opportunity. Looking forward to learn more from this community and work on exciting projects. You could join one of Omdena´s upcoming projects: www.omdena.com/projects to develop your skills, get recognised and make an impact by applying here with my code ( AZVXYABHEMR4KV ): [https://omdena.com/referrals/](https://omdena.com/referrals/)
